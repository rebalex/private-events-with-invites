This project is an assignment as part of The Odin Project. The challenge is to build a site similar to a private Eventbrite which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. The new concepts to apply to this project are modelling many-to-many relationships and being conscious about foreign keys and class names. After solving the initial challenge, the next step was to add invitations to users, which required a substantial restructuring, so instead of editing my existing project, I made a new version. I've learnt a lot about structuring models helpfully, thinking about where methods should go, using partials to reduce repetition, and some fun tweaks for datetime displays.
